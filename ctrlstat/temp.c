/*4. Temperature Advice:
Write a program that takes a temperature value as input and uses if statements to print advice based on the temperature:
Above 30: "It's hot outside, stay hydrated!"
Between 20 and 30: "The weather is nice and warm."
Between 10 and 19: "It's a bit chilly, wear a jacket."
Below 10: "It's cold outside, stay warm!"*/
